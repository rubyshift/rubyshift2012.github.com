              <h4>PostgreSQL in Highload Projects</h4>
              <p>
                PostgreSQL is a feature-packed relational database that every Rails developer should consider using. Why? I will discuss the main reasons of using this database in this talk.
              </p>

              <h3>Alvaro Videla</h3>
              <h4>RabbitMQ Hands On</h4>
              <p>
                In this talk we are going to see a short theoretical introduction to RabbitMQ and messaging in general to later dive into a live coding session to see how implement messaging into our applications. The live demo will go from starting the server and issuing basic administration commands up to creating several consumers and publishers. We will implement use cases ranging from a basic queue server to a publish subscribe system. The goal of the talk is two fold:  to see how easy is to implement a solution around messaging and to understand that we don't need to be a "big player" in order to take advantage of RabbitMQ.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alvaro Videla works at VMWare as Developer Advocate for Cloud Foundry. Before moving to Europe he used to work in Shanghai were he helped building one of Germany biggest dating websites. He co-authored the book "RabbitMQ in Action" for Manning Publishing. Some of his open source projects can be found <a href="http://github.com/videlalvaro">here</a>. Apart from code related stuff he likes traveling with his wife, listening/playing music and reading books.

              <h3>Nick Sutterer</h3>
              <h4>Off The Tracks — Challenging The Rails Mindset</h4>
              <p>
                Nick Sutterer is proud to be a member of the Ruby open source community. His Cells and Apotomo projects have been bringing increased view modularity and event-driven programming to Rails for years. He has enjoyed attending, and speaking at, Ruby conferences around the world. Buy him a beer sometime, and with very little prompting, he will tell you why there should be no such thing as a double-render error, why you should not confuse your models with your resources, and how to play a mean bass in a punk rock band.

              <h4>DataMapper 2 — an object mapping toolkit</h4>
              <p>
                Ruby developers are living in the world of Active Record. No matter what ORM you’re using, it’s an implementation of the Active Record pattern. There’s been a recent discussion in our community about separating business logic from the persistence concerns. People are experimenting with different approaches but they still use an ActiveRecord ORM under the hood.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this presentation Piotr will give you an introduction to the development of DataMapper 2 - the first true implementation of the Data Mapper pattern in Ruby language. He will talk a little bit about ORM patterns and show you core parts of DM2 that already exist and the ones they’re going to build soon.

              <h4>Modular & Reusable Front-End Code with HTML5, Sass and CoffeeScript</h4>
              <p>A lot of Ruby developers use Rails for their everyday projects. Often they toy around with front-end themselves or outsource it, ending up tangled in a web of css-all-over-the-place.</p>
              <p>Keeping your front-end code clean is hard. Before you know it you're suffering from CSS specificity issues and not-really-generic partials. Find out how to keep things tidy using the HTML5 document outline and modular Sass & CoffeeScript, for truly reusable code.</p>

              <h4>Sinatra Autopsy</h4>
              <p>Since medieval, autopsy of dead corpse was the best way of learning how human body works. We will use the same technique, examinating Sinatra, to learn how to write better code. With its 1740 lines of code, this piece of software is great example of Ruby application. We will see what jewels are hiding in its chest, notice some good practice, but also we will take a look at bad and stinky parts. Since Aleksander's only commit to Sinatra was concerned documentation, he is the right person to lead the autopsy. He will look at Sinatra with the fresh eye. Konstanin Haase won't get any hurt (probably).</p>

              <p>ZeroMQ is a socket abstraction and concurrency framework that's changing the way we think and reason about distributed systems. Mailboxes, atomic message delivery and swappable transports allow for fast, flexible and resilient network topologies. It's I/O model also sits very well with all Ruby implementations.</p>

He specializes in backend / platform / domain solutions and is well versed full stack, from VM to high level protocols and known for his offbeat Ruby patches and extensions.

              <h4>ascii.io: No nonsense asciicasting for serious hackers</h4>
              <p>In this talk Marcin will present new tool in developers' arsenal: ascii.io.</p>
              <p>Why this might be interesting to Ruby developers? The whole service is built from many parts written in many languages but the center of the whole platform is a Ruby on Rails app that glues everything together. It's an interesting example of use of many unusual techniques (one example: using tmux in Resque background jobs for thumbnail/preview generation O_o, how cool is that?). The presentation will show you why (and how) you should use tools from outside of Ruby ecosystem in your Ruby apps.</p>
              <p>Marcin is an active Ruby community member and open source contributor. You could have seen him on EuRuKo 2010 conference where he was giving presentation about interesting Rack stuff. He's also frequent speaker on Cracow's Ruby users group meetings.</p>

              <p>Stucked threads, memory leaks, blocked connections, weird errors — they all can be investigated and fixed quite easily in a short amount of time. In this talk he will tell you about JVM-toolset and show how to use it for troubleshooting your production environment.</p>
