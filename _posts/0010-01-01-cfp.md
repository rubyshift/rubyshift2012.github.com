<p>Speakers and schedule of the conference has not yet been announced. We invite you to share your thoughts with the audience and <a href="http://bai.wufoo.com/forms/rubyshift-2012-speaking-proposals/">submit a proposal</a> for a talk or a workshop.</p>
<p>We are very interested in talks and workshops on modern languages: Ruby, Clojure, JavaScript; Big Data/NoSQL: MongoDB, Riak, Redis; Concurrency and Distributed Systems: STM, eventual consistency, caching.</p>
<p>This year we introduce 30 minute sessions with 45 minute breaks to meet people, grab a bite, and relax a little bit. Workshops are not strictly time-limited, but try sticking to around 2 hours.</p>
