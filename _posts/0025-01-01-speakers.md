    <h3>Nick Sutterer</h3>
    <h4>Off The Tracks — Challenging The Rails Mindset</h4>
    <p>
      Nick Sutterer is proud to be a member of the Ruby open source community. His Cells and Apotomo projects have been bringing increased view modularity and event-driven programming to Rails for years. He has enjoyed attending, and speaking at, Ruby conferences around the world. Buy him a beer sometime, and with very little prompting, he will tell you why there should be no such thing as a double-render error, why you should not confuse your models with your resources, and how to play a mean bass in a punk rock band.

    <h3>Roy Tomeij</h3>
    <h4>Modular & Reusable Front-End Code with HTML5, Sass and CoffeeScript</h4>
    <p>A lot of Ruby developers use Rails for their everyday projects. Often they toy around with front-end themselves or outsource it, ending up tangled in a web of css-all-over-the-place.</p>
    <p>Keeping your front-end code clean is hard. Before you know it you're suffering from CSS specificity issues and not-really-generic partials. Find out how to keep things tidy using the HTML5 document outline and modular Sass & CoffeeScript, for truly reusable code.</p>

    <h3>Michael Klishin</h3>
    <h4>Becoming an Immutant: A Year with Clojure</h4>
    <p>Over a year ago I switched to using Clojure as my primary language. This will be very much an experience report: you will learn what is great about it, what isn't, how it changed my perspective on software development, simplicity, concurrency and alien life forms.</p>
    <p>Michael is a serial OSS contributor, travis-ci.org core team member, trance music lover who is passionate about JVM languages, concurrency, studying (natural) languages, data and writing boring bio blurbs for conferences.</p>

    <h3>Aleksander Dąbrowski</h3>
    <h4>Sinatra Autopsy</h4>
    <p>Since medieval, autopsy of dead corpse was the best way of learning how human body works. We will use the same technique, examinating Sinatra, to learn how to write better code. With its 1740 lines of code, this piece of software is great example of Ruby application. We will see what jewels are hiding in its chest, notice some good practice, but also we will take a look at bad and stinky parts. Since Aleksander's only commit to Sinatra was concerned documentation, he is the right person to lead the autopsy. He will look at Sinatra with the fresh eye. Konstanin Haase won't get any hurt (probably).</p>
