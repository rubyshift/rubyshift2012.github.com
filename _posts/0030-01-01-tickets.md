<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>This year we have two ticket categories: an Individual ticket for $65 and Supporter ticket for $250. For Supporter one we'll place your logo on the web site and will give you a personal thank you from our team.</p>
<p>We do our best to be closer to the open-source community. Please drop us an email if you contribute or involved in organization of a local group and we'll get you a discount or a free ticket.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we are going to transfer 10% of our ticket revenue to an open-source project of choice to appreciate their hard work. You'll be prompted to choose one from the list on checkout. Feel free to ping us at <a href="http://twitter.com/rubyshift">@rubyshift</a> in case of questions.</p>
